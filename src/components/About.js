            <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
            <p>My name is Babu Antony aka Bob Antony. I weigh 185 lbs and stand 6 feet
                 3 inches tall. I have a bachelor’s degree in English Literature and a 
                 master degree in Human Resources Management from the University of Pune,
                  India. I was the captain of the university volleyball team, and athletic teams.
                   I taught martial arts to Papal pontifical college Pune many years. My 
                   interests include painting, poetry, nature, and meeting new people. Mr. Bharatan,
                    a well-known director, introduced me to movies. I have done over 175 movies in five
                     major Indian languages (Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada). I have played 
                     a wide range of roles as hero as well as supporting actor. Some of my movies were featured
                      in national and international film festivals and won
            </p>

        <p>In “Sayanam”, I played a pauper who disobeyed all the Ten Commandments. Hence, the church buried him among other outlaws. A year later, his grave was unearthed to bury another. The church authorities were shocked to see his body intact. According to the church, only saints’ bodies remain undamaged. As a result, the church authorities began to analyze his life</p>
        <p>“Aparahnam” is another remarkable film in my career. The Sanskrit word aparahnam means the time between afternoon and evening. It is considered as the most confused part of the day. Similarly, the movie talks about the most confused stage of the character’s life. The character I played is an ex terrorist, who finds it difficult to cope with the society. Both the movies Aparahnam and Sayahnam, were directed by a very popular director called M P Sukumaran Nair. He was the co-director of the world famous director Mr. Adoor Gopalakrishnan.</p>
